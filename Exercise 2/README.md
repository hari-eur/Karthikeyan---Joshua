1. Write a program in C that takes the size of a square matrix from the user, stores all the even numbers that can fit in it, and returns the formatted square matrix. Printing should be handled by a function that takes the square matrix as an argument.

    ## Example

    ### Input
    `Enter the size of the array: 3`

    ### Output
    ```
    0  2  4  6

    8  10 12 14

    16 18 20 22

    24 26 28 30
    ```
2. Write the same calculator program as in Exercise 1, but use preprocessors and header files. In a loop, ask the user if they'd like to perform another operation or exit the program, and do so accordingly.

    ## Example

    ```
    Enter the operation: 3 + 2
    3 + 2 = 5
    Would you like to perform another operation? y

    Enter the operation: 3 * 2
    3 * 2 = 6
    Would you like to perform another operation? n

    Exiting...
    ```
